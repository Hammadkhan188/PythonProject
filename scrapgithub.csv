bottlenose,Ben Lerner,blerner@ccs.neu.edu,"Initial implementation of codereview assignments.  This is an interim
commit; many things are still broken.

- A Codereview assignment can either be a Peer review or a Self
  review.  Peer reviews can require that student review multiple
  submissions; self reviews obviously only require one

- A Codereview assignment can specify a grade threshold below which
  reviews will not be shown to the reviewees. (This helps avoid
  showing crappy or needlessly cruel reviews to students.)

- A Codereview submission creates a Grade for itself, which is the
  grade that course staff gives to the review itself.

- A Codereview submission also creates ReviewFeedbacks, one per
  submission that was reviewed, which point back to the Grade and
  which contain the graded score for this one review alone (i.e.,
  ignoring the others)

- Any submission (but typically only Files submissions) can have a
  collection of ReviewFeedbacks associated with it, which will only be
  shown if they're above the grading threshold and published (or if
  the current user is staff)

- A reviewee student can see the fact that their code has been
  reviewed, and will either be informed that the review is not yet
  unavailable, be informed that it is being withheld because it is too
  low quality, or be given a link to see the review.

- A reviewee student can see the review for their submission, but
  cannot see the grade (or staff feedback) their reviewer received.

- Reviews do not have any impact on the grade of the reviewee.

- Codereview submissions are much like Questions submissions, except
  with one additional level of indirection: the answers are chunked by
  the id of the underlying submission being reviewed.  (This ensures
  that we associate the right responses to the right submissions;
  ordering of reviews is not guaranteed or needed.)

- Questions submissions are totally broken in this commit, now.
  (Oddly, and worryingly, all tests still pass... this is more due to
  a lack of tests than a high quality of code.)

- The Interlocks table is intended to ensure various ordering
  constraints on assignments.  The model is present but this table is
  not yet used by any controllers.

- Existing Questions assignments with non-nil related assignments will
  be converted to Codereview self-review assignments.  Questions
  assignments will no longer ever have related assignments, and will
  solely be quizzes/questionnaires.  This is not yet implemented.

Miscellaneous:

- The schema for professors to supply rubrics to questions has been
  enhanced to allow giving a hint message to the graders and a separate
  feedback message to students.

- Various coding improvments (lots of conditional cruft is replaced by
  calls to &.dig(...), more functionality moved into models or
  helpers)

- Codemirror has been removed from the Gemfile.  Instead, it is now
  installed via npm, which allows us to track npm packages more
  readily (they update more frequently than the -rails equivalent gems
  do).  Likewise the pyret-mode has been removed from
  app/assets/javascript, and is now an npm mode.",2017-07-21 22:33:17-04:00

Dynamically creating comments gives them a bogus id derived from a timestamp.  The autosave AJAX gets back a dictionary from the server mapping those timestamps to proper comment ids.  Subsequent modifications of those comments will use those correct ids, so they can't be duplicated.  The problem occurs for comments that have not yet received a valid id.  If a grader clicks the submit button while the AJAX autosave request is still in flight, the grade-submission will occur first and save all the comments, and then the AJAX will occur and re-save them (since it doesn't know about the new comment ids), causing duplication.

The fix here is to disable submission while AJAX is pending.",2018-05-21 11:35:18-04:00

bottlenose,Ben Lerner,blerner@ccs.neu.edu,"Fixing #153.  This is a bit subtle:

* Until now, every Grader has either been wholly normal-points or wholly extra-credit-points.  But exams can have e.c. questions as well.
* An appealing solution is to make every Grader have *two* score fields, avail_normal_score and avail_ec_score.  But this doesn't work well: in our current setting, a ManualGrader with normal points can go above its maximum score (to allow for correcting other, overzealous autograders).  But a ManualGrader with e.c. points has a maximum it ought to go to.  If we combined these into a single grader, then we wouldn't know whether to cap the score or not.  (We don't currently cap the score for e.c. either, but there's a TODO saying we should...)
* Instead, we'll allow all Graders to self-report how many points are normal, and how many are extra-credit.  In ManualGraders, these two points should sum to the avail_score, since they're mutually exclusive.  But in ExamGraders, they may both be non-zero, and sum to more than the avail_score.

Fortunately, these scores already worked properly in the Gradesheet export (thanks to fixing #12).  This fix repairs how students see their own scores.",2019-04-04 17:57:26-04:00

When a professors messes up the exam rubric, there are (at least) three possible remedies: we might choose to delete all existing scores and try again; we might treat all scores as being scaled proportionately to the new weights; or we might treat the old scores as absolute point values.  Since Bottlenose can't choose among these three options, we present them to the professor, and edit the existing grades accordingly.  Editing the exam rubric will be rejected when:

* The number of questions (or their subparts) changes, and the professor wants to preserve existing entered grades
* The point values have lowered, scores are being treated as absolute points, and some student had a score above that new maximum

It is possible that even more fine grained policies might be possible (e.g. per-question policies), but these seem eminently reasonable and sufficient for now.",2019-04-05 18:49:12-04:00
